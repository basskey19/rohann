    <p>Roblox-based game Grow a Garden has hit a new record concurrent user level for the platform, at 21.3 MILLION on
        June 21st.

        The gardening game has set many records already as its popularity continues to grow, with its latest milestone
        making it the first and only game to surpass 20m concurrent players.

        This feat don't apply only to Roblox but makes Grow a Garden the most concurrently played game on record -
        beating everything from PUBG: Battlegrounds to Fortnite.</p>
